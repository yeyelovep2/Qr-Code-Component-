### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
@media screen and (max-width:375px) {
    .container {
        width: 100%;
    }

    .section {
        width: 70%;

    }

    .section img {
        width: 100%;
        height: 300px;
    }

    .section h4 {
        padding-bottom: 20px;
    }

    .section p {
        padding-bottom: 20px;
    }
}
```
I like how I am getting used to media query and didn't have to browse to know what to do.

### Continued development
I want to continue to understand media query and then learn how to do multiple screens for now.
